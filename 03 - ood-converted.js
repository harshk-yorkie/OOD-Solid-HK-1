/**
 *  Encapsulation
 *      - Before :- Books and members were managed globally with separate functions.
 *      - After :- Data and methods are encapsulated within the Library, Book, and Member classes.
 *  Abstraction
 *      - Before :- The implementation details were mixed with procedural logic.
 *      - After :- Book and Member classes abstract away the details of their respective attributes.
 *  Reusability
 *      - Before :- Functions were specific to their tasks and couldnâ€™t be reused in other contexts easily.
 *      - After :- Classes can be reused or extended for other types of books or members.
 *  Maintainability
 *      - Before :- Changes to the system required updating multiple functions.
 *      - After :- Changes can be made within specific classes, making the system easier to maintain.
 *  Separation of Concerns:
 *      - Before :- There was no clear separation of responsibilities.
 *      - After :- Library manages the overall system, while Book and Member handle their own data.
